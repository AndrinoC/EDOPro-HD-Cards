# EDOPro HD Cards

This for of EDOPro HD Downloader is way faster, it takes around 20 seconds to download all images for the game.
Not only I provide the source code and [compiled script](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-HD-Cards/releases/download/1.2.0/EDOProHDDownloader.exe) but also [HD images in 7z format](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-HD-Cards/releases/download/1.2.0/pics.7z). 

# Installation & Usage

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-HD-Cards/releases) and unzip it at your EDOPro folder (Default should be something like `C:/ProjectIgnis/`) and run the .exe file.

OR

Download the PICS folder from [Latest Release](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-HD-Cards/releases) and unzip them at your EDOPro game folder replacing the lower quality ones.
