# EDOPro HD Downloader Fast âš¡

# Installation & Usage

## Windows 

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader-FAST/releases) and unzip it at your EDOPro folder (Default should be something like `C:/ProjectIgnis/`) and run the .exe file.

OR

Download the source code and run build.bat.
Move EDOProHDDownloader to the EDOPro game folder and run the script.

OR

Download the PICS folder from [Latest Release](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader-FAST/releases) and unzip them at your EDOPro game folder replacing the lower quality ones.

## Non-Windows 

Since I can't test non-windows compilations you will need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Then put the compiled file at your EDOPro folder.
