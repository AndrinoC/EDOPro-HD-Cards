# EDOPro HD Downloader Fast âš¡

# Installation

## Windows

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader-FAST/releases) and unzip it at your EDOPro folder (Default should be something like `C:/ProjectIgnis/`).

## Non-Windows

Since I can't test non-windows compilations you will need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Then put the compiled file at your EDOPro folder.


# Usage

If you run the program and read the instructions you should be fine.

But for short:
- Select the amount of workers to be used based on your CPU cores. 

- Insert the name of your deck (without the `.ydk` extension) when asked to download all the images of the cards in it.

- Insert `/allcards` to download images for all cards. Will probably take a while.

- Insert `/allfields` to download artwork of all Field Spell Cards.

- Insert `/help` if you want to know anything else.
