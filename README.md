# EDOPro HD Downloader Fast âš¡

# Installation

## Windows 

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AndrinoC/EDOPro-Hd-Downloader-FAST/releases) and unzip it at your EDOPro folder (Default should be something like `C:/ProjectIgnis/`).

## Non-Windows 

Since I can't test non-windows compilations you will need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Then put the compiled file at your EDOPro folder.

# Usage

- Double click EDOProHDDownloader.exe
